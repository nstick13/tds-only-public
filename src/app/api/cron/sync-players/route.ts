// sync-players
//
// Pulls the whole-league player pool from Tank01 (RapidAPI) and upserts
// QB/RB/WR/TE into the global `players` table, including injury status (the
// `injury` object is embedded on the SAME player-list row — so this one job
// covers both the initial roster pull and the ongoing injury-status refresh;
// no separate job and no getNFLInjuryList call needed). Never falls back to
// stale/cached data on a bad fetch — a failure aborts the run and logs an
// 'error' sync_log row instead.
//
// League-blind by construction: `players` is instance-wide, so this job is
// identical whether one league or fifty are running.
//
// Quota: one paginated getNFLPlayerList chain (page size 1000, ~3 pages),
// i.e. ~3 API calls per run — replacing the old ESPN shape of 1 team-index
// call + 32 per-team roster calls (33 calls). getPlayerList() throws rather
// than returning a partial pool if pagination doesn't terminate.
//
// Every field read below is verified against the captured response in
// reference-league/reference/tank01/getNFLPlayerList.sample.json. Do not add a
// field that isn't in that sample.
