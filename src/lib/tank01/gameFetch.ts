/**
 * Decide whether this game's box score can still tell us something new.
 *
 * - Not kicked off  -> no stats exist yet. Never fetch.
 * - Stale-scheduled -> still flagged "Scheduled" long after it must have
 *                      ended, so the status is wrong, not the clock. Fetch.
 * - Final           -> stats are frozen, so fetch it exactly once: skip only
 *                      when a previous run that fetched EVERY game cleanly
 *                      happened well after this game must have ended. (A run
 *                      with any failed fetch logs status 'error' and so never
 *                      advances this watermark — deliberately conservative.)
 * - Anything else   -> in progress / delayed / unknown. Fetch.
 *
 * Why the stale-scheduled case exists
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Tank01 does not flip gameStatus off "Scheduled" promptly — the 2026 Week 1
 * Thursday opener (kickoff 00:20Z) was still reported as "Scheduled" at
 * 10:00Z and only went "Completed" around 10:08Z, roughly ten hours after
 * kickoff. That lag silently broke the watermark: every run during the stale
 * window skipped the game as "not yet kicked off" while still logging
 * success, so by the time the status flipped, lastClean was already past
 * kickoff + GAME_SETTLED_MS and the game was written off as
 * "final-already-ingested" — even though no run had ever fetched it. The
 * whole opener scored zero and Week 1 standings stayed empty.
 *
 * Fetching a stale-scheduled game closes that hole at its source: once a
 * game is past kickoff + GAME_SETTLED_MS, EVERY status leads to a fetch
 * (scheduled and live directly, final via the watermark), so a run can only
 * be clean after it has actually seen the game. That restores the
 * watermark's induction — a clean run past that point really did ingest
 * every game it covers — and costs at most one extra call per stuck game.
 *
 * `lastClean` is supplied PER WEEK by the caller, not read globally; see the
 * watermark note in src/app/api/cron/sync-scores/route.ts for why the
 * instance-wide sync_log timestamp alone is no longer a safe answer.
